# Dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles for my different workstations using Linux, macOS and Windows.

These files are always synchronised using [DotBot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), a tool that *bootstraps* the dotfiles.

# Why dotfiles?
When you are working in tech, at some point it will become frequent to change computers, or maybe even have more than one, even if it is just a personal computer and another one for work. 
The issue appears when you want to have the same configuration profile for your apps on both, or when you just get a new machine and now have to set everything upand try to not miss anything from your old configuration...  
To avoid these issues, it is best to keep a copy of your configuration files (*dotfiles*), or even better, have a way to easily integrate/synchronise these dotfiles in any machine.
